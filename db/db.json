        "This bannocks recipe is exactly what Antarctic explorer, Ernest Shackleton, and his crew would have used. Bannocks as explorer survival food. Bannocks are a circular flatbread originally from Scotland and the north of England. Our bannocks are made from einkorn flour, salt, baking powder, water, and butter. They're a very simple and versatile form of bread."
